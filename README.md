Scans SQL Server Databases for Security Vulnerabilities

Uses the same Vulnerability database found in SSMS 17.4+, and Azure Defender for SQL but runs for ALL Databases on a server, not just one at a time like SSMS does

Note:
MS removed this feature from SSMS 19.1 so they could charge for the same thing as Defender

Defender doesnt actively scan for anything, which can be solved by incooperating this solution as an API.

Input:
Run-MSVAScan.ps1 -instance SQLSERVERINSTANCE [-User SQLAuthUser] [-Password SQLAuthPassword]

Output:
*HTML file with a scan summary sorted by Severity
*HTML file with a scan summary sorted by Database
*Text file with TSQL Remediation Code for each scanned Database
