## Description

Scans SQL Server Databases for Security Vulnerabilities 
</br></br>

Uses the same Vulnerability database found in SSMS 17.4+, and Azure Defender for SQL but runs for ALL Databases on a server, not just one at a time like SSMS does.
</br></br>

Note:
MS removed this feature from SSMS 19.1 and they now charge for this feature in Defender.

Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/sql-vulnerability-assessment?view=sql-server-ver16#removal-of-the-sql-vulnerability-assessment-in-sql-server-management-studio-191
</br></br>

Defender doesnt actively scan for anything, which can be solved by incooperating this solution as an API.
</br></br>

Input:
Run-MSVAScan.ps1 -instance SQLSERVERINSTANCE [-User SQLAuthUser] [-Password SQLAuthPassword]

</br></br>

*HTML file with a scan summary sorted by Severity
